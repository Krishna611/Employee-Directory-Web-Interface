# 👩‍💼 AJACKUS Employee Directory

This is a simple, responsive **Employee Directory** web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, with mock Freemarker template structure. It allows users to manage employee records — including viewing, adding, editing, deleting, searching, sorting, and paginating — all using mock data in the browser (no backend required).

## 💡 Reflection

### 🔧 Challenges Faced

- Handling pagination and filtering in memory

### 🛠 Improvements (With More Time)
- Store data using `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`
- Add animations/transitions for better UX
- Create a reusable component-based architecture
- Add unit tests for JavaScript logic
